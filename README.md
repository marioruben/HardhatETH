# Sample Hardhat Project ( Hello World)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Start running some of the following tasks:

```
git clone https://github.com/marioruben/HardhatETH.git
cd HardhatETH
npm install
```

```
npm install dotenv
```

Let's configure mnemonic key (Secret) and RPC_NODE (Node generated by infura or other provider):
Go to .env archive and put
RPC_NODE = <your RPC_NODE>
CHAIN_ID = 11155111
SECRET = <your mnemonic>

Now, let's compile Hardhat project HelloWorld: 
```
npx hardhat compile
```

To deploy the contract use: 
```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/HelloWorld.ts --network sepolia
```
